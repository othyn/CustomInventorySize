# CustomInventorySize
Factorio mod to allow for custom inventory sizes.

Defaults to 120 (2x), but allows you to configure it anywhere from 60 (factorio default) to 480 (8x).

Mod can be downloaded in game, via the [factorio mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Othyn/Custom%20Inventory%20Size) or a build can be found in the repo's `/dist` directory.

Inspired by the original ["Larger Inventory"](https://github.com/Rseding91/Larger-Inventory) mod by [Rseding91](https://github.com/Rseding91).

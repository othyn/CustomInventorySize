Defaults to 120 (2x), but allows you to configure it anywhere from 60 (factorio default) to 480 (8x).

Mod can be downloaded via any of these:
- In game through the mod menu (best option)
- The [factorio mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Othyn/Custom%20Inventory%20Size)
- A build can be found in the repo's `/dist` directory.

Inspired by the original ["Larger Inventory"](https://github.com/Rseding91/Larger-Inventory) mod by [Rseding91](https://github.com/Rseding91).

# CustomInventorySize
Factorio mod to allow for custom inventory sizes, simple as that.

Defaults to 120 (2x), but allows you to configure it anywhere from 60 (factorio default) to 480 (8x).

Inspired by the original ["Larger Inventory"](https://github.com/Rseding91/Larger-Inventory) mod by [Rseding91](https://github.com/Rseding91).
